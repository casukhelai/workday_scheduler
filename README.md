# workday_scheduler -- Homework 5

## Description
This is a workday planner for an individual to keep track of their day as the day goes on. It is color coded; grey represents past time, red is the current time of the user, and green represents the future time. Just type in the box, save and watch your day plans be saved!

- My motivation was to build my JavaScript as efficient as possible, while having the appropriate number of functions to properly execute the page
What I learned:
- I built this project to understand my struggles with understanding DOM manipulation
- I learned how to use $(" ") syntax to create functions

## Installation
Nothing special to install

## Usage
When you load the page, you'll see a big header with today's (changing each day) and you'll see a bunch of different times to type into. Hit the save button and your description will be saved! If you have to walk away and close/refresh the page, that description will be saved until it is cleared from your local storage!
